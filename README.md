# My Toy interpreter project

There are 2 Intellij run configurations:

1. Main -> for the CLI
2. GUI_Main -> for the GUI, uses JavaFX SDK

Java application for interpreting the instructions of a language
similar to C, with concurrency support for the “fork” statement.
Implemented using Object-Oriented concepts, Java generics and
MVC architecture.

The application features a Syntax Parser that lets the user write a
natural Toy program in any text file, then extracts the statements
and expressions to build the entire program, stopping in case of
any syntax error.

Learned about Functional Programming, Collections, Concurrency
in Java, as well as other numerous particularities of the language.
